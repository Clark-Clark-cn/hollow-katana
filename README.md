# Hollow Katana

[中文说明](README_CN.md)

This is a small game that blends elements of Hollow Knight and Katana Zero. As the Katana Zero player, you must defeat the AI-controlled Hornet. She has a variety of attack patterns—you need to stay alive, find the right timing, and deliver a fatal blow!

## Game Features

1. Health: The health system is similar to Hollow Knight’s. You start with 10 hearts by default. Each time you’re hit, you lose one heart. You must defeat Hornet before you lose all your hearts, otherwise the game will end in failure.
2. Attacks: Click inside the window with your mouse to attack. The attack direction points toward the position where you click.
3. Movement: Use WASD for actions: W to jump, A/D to move left/right, S to roll.
4. Rolling: While rolling, you are immune to Hornet’s damage. It’s an effective way to dodge her attacks.

## Build and Run

1. Install Visual Studio and EasyX.
2. Open the .sln file in the repository.
3. Build and run.

## AI Usage

This project barely uses AI, except for code autocompletion and translating the README file.
